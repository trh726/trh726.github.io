# Develop for Gecko Designs

https://gecko-designs.github.io/develop-for-gecko/

## Goal

Build out your own version of this test application using this repository as a starting point.

The end result should look and function just like the application included in the sample directory:

Sample App: https://gecko-designs.github.io/develop-for-gecko/sample/

You don't need to develop any of the signup/login functionality, a user should be able to continue to the Products list by submitting the form, they don't need to authenticate with any service.

You're free to use any solutions you see fit, there are plenty of intentional errors ranging from basic fixes to more complex problems that aren't readily apparent but easy to remedy.

Show us what you got!

## Getting Started

Start by cloning this repo. Explore the code, there are plenty of issues (placed intentionally) for you to fix.

This is the API endpoint you can use for pulling up a list of Products:

* https://5d445466d823c30014771642.mockapi.io/api/v1/products

Use GitHub pages to host your final build.

## What We're Looking For

* Attention to detail - did you include all of the small details?
* Understanding of applied technologies - can you explain your solutions?
* Problem solving skills - how would you solve these problems differently?

## Technologies

* JS, CSS, HTML
* GIT
* Webpack
* React
* Sass

## Additional Requirements

To successfully pass this test after you've finished you must log your name/pseudonym in the console.
